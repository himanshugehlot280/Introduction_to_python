"""
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code
python will give you error if you skip the indentation
the number of spaces is up to you as a programmer. but it has to be at least one
you have to use the same number of spaces in same block of code, otherwise
python will give you an error

below there are two programs which elaborate the need of indentation in python program

"""
# ----------------1)----------------------- no error code
if 5 > 2:
    print('no error')

# ---------------2)------------------------error code
# if 5>2:
# print('error')
# print('above code consist error ')
